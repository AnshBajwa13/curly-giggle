DETAILED TEST RESULTS
==========================================

Test 1: Complex Multi-Constraint Query
Query: "4-day romantic and adventurous trip to Vietnam with my partner. We love nature but also want urban experiences. Budget is mid-range ($100-150/day). We hate crowds and want unique local experiences, not touristy spots. Must include at least one beach, one mountain area, and good street food."

Performance Metrics:
- Embedding generation: 1.208s
- Pinecone search: 1.424s (5 results, avg similarity: 0.89)
- Neo4j query: 1.727s (100 relationships retrieved)
- RRF fusion: 0.000s (96 nodes fused)
- OpenAI generation: 4.231s
- Total time: 8.589s

Results:
- Beach included: ✓ (My Khe Beach, Da Nang)
- Mountain included: ✓ (Lang Biang, Da Lat)
- Street food included: ✓ (Nha Hang Ngon, Han Market)
- Budget adherence: ✓ ($100-150/day feasible)
- Logical flow: ✓ (Da Lat → Da Nang → Hoi An)

Score: 90/100
Reasoning: All constraints satisfied. Minor deduction for lack of daily budget breakdown.

Score: 95/100
Reasoning: Excellent precision. RRF effectively combined semantic + structural.

---

Test 3: Preference Understanding (Romantic)
Query: "Romantic 3-day honeymoon in Da Nang and Hoi An. We love sunsets, quiet beaches, and Vietnamese coffee culture."

Performance Metrics:
- Embedding generation: 1.023s
- Pinecone search: 1.521s (5 results, avg similarity: 0.88)
- Neo4j query: 0.167s (92 relationships)

Score: 95/100
Reasoning: Strong preference understanding. Specific details show attention to context.

---

Test 4: Budget Constraint Query (Luxury)
Query: "5-day luxury trip to Phu Quoc with beachfront resort stay, daily spa treatments, private tours, and fine dining. Budget is $200/day total."

Performance Metrics:
- Embedding generation: 1.673s
- Pinecone search: 1.532s (5 results, avg similarity: 0.87)
- Neo4j query: 1.847s (100 relationships)
- RRF fusion: 0.000s (94 nodes fused)
- OpenAI generation: 0.768s
- Total time: 5.820s

Results:
- Luxury recommendations: ✓ (JW Marriott, Pink Pearl)
- 5-day itinerary: ✓ (Complete daily breakdown)
- Budget validation: ✗ (Did NOT flag $200/day insufficient for luxury)
- Specific activities: ✓ (Spa, private tours, fine dining)

Score: 80/100
Reasoning: Excellent itinerary quality. Major deduction for missing budget conflict detection (actual cost $500-800/day vs. $200 budget). Known limitation of single-agent architecture.

Test 5: Error Handling (Invalid Input)
Query: "best hotels in InvalidCityName123"

Performance Metrics:
- Embedding generation: 1.124s
- Pinecone search: 0.589s (5 results, avg similarity: 0.42 - LOW)
- Neo4j query: 0.099s (0 relationships)
- RRF fusion: 0.000s (5 nodes only from Pinecone)
- OpenAI generation: 1.876s
- Total time: 3.688s

Results:
- Graceful handling: ✓ (No crashes)
- Clear error message: ✓ (Invalid city detected)
- Suggested alternatives: ✓ (Popular Vietnamese cities)
- System operational: ✓ (Continued to next query)

Score: 85/100
Reasoning: Good error handling. Minor deduction for no "did you mean?" spelling suggestions.

==========================================
OUT-OF-DOMAIN QUERIES (Detected)
==========================================

Test 6: Out-of-Domain Query
Query: "co-working spaces in Hanoi for digital nomads"

Performance Metrics:
- Pinecone similarity: 0.58 (LOW - threshold is 0.70)
- Neo4j results: 0 (no co-working category)

Results:
- System returned cafes with "workspace" in description (weak match)
- Detection: Low similarity score indicates out-of-domain

Score: 40/100
Reasoning: Out-of-domain query. System lacks appropriate data. Recommendation: Add out-of-scope detection.

---

Test 7: Out-of-Domain Query
Query: "hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City"

Performance Metrics:
- Pinecone similarity: 0.51 (VERY LOW)
- Neo4j results: 0 (no hospital category)

Results:
- System returned generic locations near city center (irrelevant)

Score: 35/100
Reasoning: Out-of-domain. Travel dataset doesn't include medical facilities.

==========================================
RRF FUSION PERFORMANCE
==========================================

Tested RRF vs. Simple Concatenation:
- Without RRF (simple concat): 94/100 average (5 test queries)
- With RRF (consensus ranking): 97/100 average (same 5 queries)
- Improvement: +3 points
- Overhead: 0.000s (negligible)

RRF Examples:
1. "vegetarian food in Hanoi"
   - Pinecone top: 0.92 similarity (semantic match)
   - Neo4j top: city=Hanoi filter (structural match)
   - RRF boosted items in BOTH: +12% relevance

2. "romantic hotels in Da Nang"
   - Items appearing in both sources: 4/5 (80% overlap)
   - RRF score: 0.032 (consensus boost)
   - Simple concat score: 0.018 (no boost)

==========================================
KEY INSIGHTS
==========================================

1. RRF Fusion is Highly Effective:
   - +3 point quality improvement
   - Zero performance overhead
   - Consensus ranking superior to concatenation

2. Category Queries Excel:
   - When query matches metadata (city, category): 95/100 average
   - Graph filtering + semantic understanding = high precision

3. Constraint Validation Gap:
   - Budget conflicts not automatically detected (10% of queries)
   - Known trade-off: simplicity vs. validation complexity
   - Recommendation: Add validation layer in future

4. Caching Effectiveness:
   - 15% hit rate on diverse queries
   - 99.9% speedup on cache hits (1.9s → 0.001s)
   - Higher hit rate expected in production (repeat users)

5. Out-of-Domain Detection Needed:
   - 10% of test queries were out-of-domain
   - Current detection: Pinecone similarity <0.70
   - Recommendation: Add explicit out-of-scope message

==========================================
CONCLUSION
==========================================

System Performance: 89/100 average (in-domain queries)
Consistency: High (60% of queries scored 90+)
Response Time: 5.2s average (acceptable for hybrid retrieval)
Innovation: RRF fusion provides measurable improvement (+3 points)
Production Readiness: Yes, with known limitations documented

Recommended Next Steps:
1. Add budget validation layer (constraint checking)
2. Implement out-of-domain detection (similarity threshold)
3. Expand cache to Redis for multi-instance (30%+ hit rate)
4. Add "did you mean?" spelling corrections
