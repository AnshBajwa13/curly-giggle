# Multi-Agent System Fixes Applied

## Date: Test 1 Analysis & Improvements

---

## 🐛 Issues Identified from Test 1 (Complex Constraints)

### Single-Agent Performance: 90/100 ✅
- All constraints met (beach, mountain, street food)
- Logical geography (Da Lat → Da Nang → Hoi An)
- Budget within range ($100-150/day)
- Fast (3.3s), streaming, specific venues

### Multi-Agent Performance: 65/100 ❌
**Validation Correctly Identified Issues:**
1. ❌ Impossible geography (Da Nang → Hoi An → Da Lat → Sapa)
2. ❌ Budget exceeded ($160/day vs $100-150 max)
3. ❌ Missing beach on Day 4 (Sapa has no beach)
4. ❌ Agent 2 JSON parsing error

**Root Cause:** Agent 2 returned invalid JSON → fallback strategy → Agent 3 created bad itinerary → Agent 5 caught it (65/100)

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Agent 2 JSON Parsing (Critical)

**Problem:**
```
[AGENT 2] Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
```

**Root Cause:** OpenAI sometimes returns JSON wrapped in markdown code blocks or with extra text.

**Solution:**
1. **Improved Prompt**: Added explicit JSON structure example
2. **Improved Parsing**: Strip markdown code blocks (```json ... ```)
3. **Enhanced Fallback**: Uses query_analysis to determine optimal top_k

**Code Changes:**
```python
# Before:
plan = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)

# After:
content = response.choices[0].message.content.strip()
# Remove markdown code blocks if present
if content.startswith("```"):
    content = content.split("```")[1]
    if content.startswith("json"):
        content = content[4:]
    content = content.strip()
plan = json.loads(content)
```

**System Prompt Enhancement:**
```python
"""CRITICAL: You MUST return ONLY a valid JSON object with this EXACT structure:
{
  "vector_query": "optimized search query string",
  "graph_filters": {"include": ["category1", "category2"], "exclude": []},
  "top_k": 7,
  "priority_nodes": ["City", "Activity"],
  "search_strategy": "focused_refinement"
}

NO additional text, NO markdown, ONLY the JSON object."""
```

### Fix 2: Agent 3 Venue Specificity (Major)

**Problem:** Agent 3 used generic placeholders:
- "a local market" instead of "Dong Xuan Market"
- "a cooking school" instead of "Hanoi Cooking Centre"
- "a local restaurant" instead of specific names

**Solution:** Enhanced system prompt with strict rules:

**Added Rules:**
```python
"""CRITICAL RULES:
6. **ALWAYS use SPECIFIC VENUE NAMES from context** (e.g., "My Khe Beach", not "a beach")
7. **ALWAYS use SPECIFIC RESTAURANT NAMES** if mentioned in context
9. Include realistic travel times between locations
10. Consider geographic logic (don't jump 500km between days)

FORBIDDEN:
- Generic placeholders like "a local market", "a cooking school"
- Unrealistic distances (e.g., Da Lat to Sapa in one day)
- Budget estimates (another agent handles that)"""
```

**Expected Impact:** Agent 3 will now extract and use specific venue names from RAG context.

---

### Fix 3: Enhanced Error Handling

**Agent 2 Fallback:**
```python
# Before: Fixed top_k=5
"top_k": 5

# After: Dynamic based on duration
top_k = 7 if query_analysis.get('duration_days', 0) > 3 else 5
"top_k": top_k
```

**Benefit:** Longer trips get more retrieval results for better variety.

## 📊 Expected Improvements

### Before Fixes:
| Test | Score | Issues |
|------|-------|--------|
| Test 1 | 65/100 | Agent 2 error, bad geography, generic venues |
| Test 3 | 70/100 | Missing specific venue names |
| Test 4 | 95/100 | ✅ Working correctly |

### After Fixes (Expected):
| Test | Score | Expected Outcome |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Test 1 | 85-95/100 | Better geography, specific venues |
| Test 3 | 90-100/100 | Real restaurant/market names |
| Test 4 | 95-100/100 | Maintained or improved |

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### Immediate Re-test:
1. **Test 1 (Complex Constraints)** - Should now score 85-95/100
   - Check: No Agent 2 errors
   - Check: Realistic geography (no Da Lat→Sapa same day)
   - Check: Specific venue names from context

2. **Test 3 (Vegetarian Food Tour)** - Should now score 90-100/100
   - Check: "Dong Xuan Market" instead of "a local market"
   - Check: Specific restaurant names for cooking class
   - Check: 5 dishes with real names

3. **Test 4 (Romantic Honeymoon)** - Verify still works (95/100+)
   - Regression test to ensure fixes don't break working cases

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Multi-Agent is Fixed if:
✅ Agent 2 JSON errors eliminated (no "Expecting value" errors)
✅ Test 1 scores 85+ (was 65)
✅ Test 3 scores 90+ (was 70)
✅ Specific venue names appear (no "a local X" placeholders)
✅ Geographic logic improved (no 500km+ day trips)

### Validation Still Works:
✅ Test 2 (impossible timeline) still scores 40-50/100
✅ Agent 5 still catches errors and warnings
✅ Validation scores vary appropriately by query difficulty

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **multi_agent_system.py**:
   - Lines ~105-115: Agent 2 system prompt (added JSON structure)
   - Lines ~137-165: Agent 2 JSON parsing (added markdown stripping)
   - Lines ~199-213: Agent 3 system prompt (added venue specificity rules)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Re-run Test 1 (Immediate)
```bash
python hybrid_chat.py
# Select: 2 (Multi-Agent)
# Query: I want a 4-day romantic and adventurous trip to Vietnam...
```

**Expected:**
- No Agent 2 errors
- Score: 85-95/100
- Realistic geography (Da Lat→Da Nang→Hoi An or similar)
- Specific venue names

### 2. Re-run Test 3 (Verify Fix)
```bash
# Query: Plan a 3-day food tour in Hanoi...
```

**Expected:**
- "Dong Xuan Market" (not "a local market")
- Specific cooking school name
- Score: 90-100/100

### 3. Compare Results
- Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent (fixed) on same query
- Multi-Agent should now be competitive or better

---

## 💡 Why These Fixes Matter

### Fix 1 (Agent 2 JSON):
**Impact:** Prevents cascade failures. When Agent 2 fails, retrieval strategy is suboptimal → Agent 3 gets bad data → bad itinerary → low validation score.

### Fix 2 (Agent 3 Specificity):
**Impact:** Makes responses actionable. Users can actually visit "Morning Glory Restaurant" vs. searching for "a local restaurant."

### Fix 3 (Error Handling):
**Impact:** Graceful degradation. Even if Agent 2 fails, fallback is now smarter (dynamic top_k).

## 🎓 Technical Lessons Learned

### 1. LLM JSON Output is Unreliable
**Learning:** Always strip markdown code blocks, validate structure
**Solution:** Preprocessing before json.loads()

### 2. Prompt Engineering is Critical
**Learning:** "Use specific names" → ignored. "ALWAYS use SPECIFIC VENUE NAMES from context (e.g., 'My Khe Beach', not 'a beach')" → followed.
**Solution:** Be explicit with examples and forbidden patterns

### 3. Agent 5 Validation is Gold
**Learning:** Even when other agents fail, Agent 5 correctly identifies issues
**Evidence:** Test 1 scored 65/100 (correct - itinerary was flawed)
**Value:** Self-awareness prevents confident delivery of bad answers

## 📈 Expected Score Impact

### Overall System Score:
| Version | Score | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| v2.2 (Single-Agent + RRF) | 97/100 | Baseline |
| v3.0 (Multi-Agent - Before Fixes) | 65-95/100 | Inconsistent |
| **v3.0 (Multi-Agent - After Fixes)** | **85-100/100** | **Target** |

### Submission Readiness:
- **Before Fixes**: Not ready (Test 1 & 3 scored 65-70)
- **After Fixes**: Ready if scores improve to 85-95+

---

## ✅ Conclusion

**Fixes Applied:** 3 critical improvements
**Testing Status:** Ready for re-test
**Expected Outcome:** Multi-agent scores 85-100/100 on all tests
**Validation Status:** Already working perfectly (Agent 5)

**Next Action:** Re-run Test 1 to verify fixes work! 🚀
