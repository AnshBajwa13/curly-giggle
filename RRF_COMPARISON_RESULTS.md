```
DEBUG: RRF fusion - Combined 5 vector + 76 graph nodes into 76 fused results
```
- ‚úÖ Fused 5 Pinecone results with 76 unique Neo4j nodes
- ‚úÖ Created unified ranking of 76 nodes
- ‚úÖ Selected top 20 for context

**Query 2 (Adventure):**
```
DEBUG: RRF fusion - Combined 5 vector + 40 graph nodes into 40 fused results

## Critical Analysis: Why After RRF is Better

### Strengths of v2.2 (After RRF):

1. **Unified Ranking System:**
   - Both Pinecone and Neo4j "vote" on best results
   - Consensus-based recommendations
   - Better quality control

2. **More Specific Details:**
   - Valley of Love (romantic)
   - Fansipan pricing ($50-100)
   - Specific market names
   - Duration per activity

3. **Better Format Adaptation:**
   - Romantic ‚Üí Day-by-day itinerary
   - Adventure ‚Üí Activity-based list

4. **Negligible Performance Cost:**
   - RRF fusion: 0.000s (essentially free!)
   - Total time increase due to OpenAI variance, not RRF

### Weaknesses of v2.2:

1. **Slightly Slower Overall:**
   - Query 1: +1.18s (21% slower)
   - Query 2: +0.163s (6% slower)
   - **BUT:** Variance is normal, not RRF's fault
   - RRF itself is 0.000s

2. **Limited Improvement When Data is Scarce:**
   - Food query: Only 7 graph nodes
   - RRF can't improve much with limited data
   - Still good results, but not dramatically better
